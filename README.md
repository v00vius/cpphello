## cpphello
An object oriented version of a "Hello World" program in C++
that it should have been :)

### Compile and run
To make it working, just download it and compile using your favorite compiler.
For example, at command prompt:
- using gcc:

    `g++ hello.cpp -o hello`

- using clang

    `clang++ hello.cpp -o hello`

This gives an executable 'hello'

Then type `./hello`

Possible output:

_Hello world!_
